Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal
2 oz Mezcal
3/4 oz Chocolate liqueur
1/2 oz Coffee liqueur

To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):

4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin.


Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated.

Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.


Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other.

Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan.

Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours.

When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.


If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.

To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.


Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container.

Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight.

When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise.

If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat.

There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.


The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.



Habanero tincture

Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.

Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.

Cocktail

Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.

Strain into chilled coupe.

Carefully "sink" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.

Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.

Vampiro
6 cl Tequila
3 cl Tomato Juice
3 cl Orange Juice
1.5 cl Lime Juice
1 dash Sugar Syrup
1 pinch Salt

Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass.

Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim.

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila.

The next stage is to add the flavouring elements.

This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo).

The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.

Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal
2 oz Mezcal
3/4 oz Chocolate liqueur
1/2 oz Coffee liqueur

To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):

4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin.


Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated.

Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.


Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other.

Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan.

Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours.

When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.


If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.

To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.


Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container.

Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight.

When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise.

If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat.

There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.


The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.



Habanero tincture

Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.

Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.

Cocktail

Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.

Strain into chilled coupe.

Carefully "sink" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.

Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.

Vampiro
6 cl Tequila
3 cl Tomato Juice
3 cl Orange Juice
1.5 cl Lime Juice
1 dash Sugar Syrup
1 pinch Salt

Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass.

Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim.

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila.

The next stage is to add the flavouring elements.

This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo).

The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.

Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal
2 oz Mezcal
3/4 oz Chocolate liqueur
1/2 oz Coffee liqueur

To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):

4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin.


Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated.

Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.


Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other.

Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan.

Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours.

When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.


If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.

To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.


Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container.

Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight.

When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise.

If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat.

There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.


The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.



Habanero tincture

Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.

Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.

Cocktail

Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.

Strain into chilled coupe.

Carefully "sink" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.

Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.

Vampiro
6 cl Tequila
3 cl Tomato Juice
3 cl Orange Juice
1.5 cl Lime Juice
1 dash Sugar Syrup
1 pinch Salt

Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass.

Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim.

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila.

The next stage is to add the flavouring elements.

This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo).

The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.

If it is not frothy, add more milk, or even just some more milk powder.

The froth gradually turns to liquid at the bottom of the glass, so you will find that you can sit and drink this for about 1/2 hour, with more iced coffee continually appearing at the bottom.

Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal
2 oz Mezcal
3/4 oz Chocolate liqueur
1/2 oz Coffee liqueur

To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):

4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin.


Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated.

Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.


Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other.

Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan.

Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours.

When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.


If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.

To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.


Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container.

Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight.

When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise.

If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat.

There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.


The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.



Habanero tincture

Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.

Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.

Cocktail

Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.

Strain into chilled coupe.

Carefully "sink" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.

Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.

Vampiro
6 cl Tequila
3 cl Tomato Juice
3 cl Orange Juice
1.5 cl Lime Juice
1 dash Sugar Syrup
1 pinch Salt

Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass.

Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim.

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila.

The next stage is to add the flavouring elements.

This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo).

The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.

Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal
2 oz Mezcal
3/4 oz Chocolate liqueur
1/2 oz Coffee liqueur

To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):

4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin.


Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated.

Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.


Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other.

Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan.

Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours.

When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.


If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.

To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.


Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container.

Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight.

When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise.

If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat.

There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.


The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail.



Habanero tincture

Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.

Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.

Cocktail

Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.

Strain into chilled coupe.

Carefully "sink" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.

Garnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.

Vampiro
6 cl Tequila
3 cl Tomato Juice
3 cl Orange Juice
1.5 cl Lime Juice
1 dash Sugar Syrup
1 pinch Salt

Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass.

Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim.

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila.

If it is not frothy, add more milk, or even just some more milk powder.

The froth gradually turns to liquid at the bottom of the glass, so you will find that you can sit and drink this for about 1/2 hour, with more iced coffee continually appearing at the bottom.
